# Goal file

A goal is one markdown file per thread: `goal.md`. It is written by you (or drafted by Claude and edited
by you), then **approved**. Nothing runs before approval, and a change after approval returns it to draft.

## Shape

```markdown
---
id: g-2026-10-12-retry-backoff
title: Add retry with backoff to the sync client
status: approved            # draft | approved
base: main                  # branch the worktree is cut from
budget_usd: 5.00            # hard cap passed to the CLI
turn_timeout_min: 30        # runner kills the turn after this
approved_at: 2026-10-12T20:10:00Z
approved_hash: 3f2a...      # hash of everything below the front matter
---

## Request

Add exponential retry with jitter to `SyncClient.fetch`, max 5 attempts.

## Criteria

- [c1] `SyncClient.fetch` retries on 5xx and network errors, not on 4xx.
  - proof: test `SyncClientTests.retries*` pass
- [c2] Delay grows exponentially with jitter and is capped at 30s.
  - proof: unit test with injected clock
- [c3] The settings screen shows no change.
  - proof: screenshot of Settings

## Out of scope

- Changing the request timeout.
- Retrying uploads.
```

## Rules

- **Criteria are checkable.** Each has an id (`c1`…) and a `proof` line saying how it will be shown.
  `proof` is free text for now; typed proofs (`check:`, `screenshot:`, `diff:`) are described in
  [`later/proof.md`](../later/proof.md).
- **Approval binds a hash.** `approved_hash` covers the body (request, criteria, out of scope) and the front
  matter fields that change what runs (`base`, `budget_usd`, `turn_timeout_min`). Edit any of them
  and the status is `draft` again.
- **Out of scope is part of the contract.** The runner puts it in the prompt and the review shows it.
- **The goal is the only input.** The runner builds the first prompt from the goal and nothing else.

## Tool permissions

One fixed set per project, in `.workbench/config.toml` (no named profiles until there is a real need):

```toml
check_command = "scripts/check.sh"

[tools]
allowed = ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Edit", "Write",
           "Bash(git status:*)", "Bash(git diff:*)", "Bash(git add:*)", "Bash(git commit:*)",
           "Bash(swift build:*)", "Bash(swift test:*)"]
denied  = ["Bash(git push:*)", "Bash(gh pr merge:*)", "Bash(rm -rf:*)"]
```

Notes:

- The set is passed as `--allowedTools` / `--disallowedTools`. With `--permission-prompts none`, anything
  not allowed is denied automatically. That is the whole permission system.
- `check_command` (P2) is added to `allowed` so Claude can run its own checks.
- This is an allowlist, not a sandbox. P1 spike S3 tests what the CLI does with compound commands and
  `cd`; whatever it does not stop, the worktree and the absence of credentials must.
